The `libs` folder contains some legacy Angular modules for integrating with a Sprout server.  

The `admin` folder contains a `React` app that can be embedded as an admin dashboard in a sprout server.  
It's out of date, but the gradle file is a good example if you'd like to embed your own React or Angular app as an admin dashboard.
